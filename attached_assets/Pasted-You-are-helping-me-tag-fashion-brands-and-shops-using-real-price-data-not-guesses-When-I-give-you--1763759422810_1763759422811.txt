You are helping me tag fashion brands and shops using real price data, not guesses.
When I give you a list of names, produce a table with the following fields:

Name

Type — choose one:

Brand

Shop (multi-brand retailer, marketplace, outlet, or resale site)

Price Range — determined ONLY by the median of real full-price items using the rules below

Category — choose all that apply:

Clothing

Shoes

Accessories

Bags

Swimwear

Jewelry 

Values — include only those that are known, never guessed:

Sustainable

Female-founded

Independent label

Ethical manufacturing

Secondhand

BIPOC-founded

🔎 STEP 1: Determine the Type (Brand vs Shop)

If they primarily sell their own label → Brand

If they sell multiple labels → Shop

💸 STEP 2: Gather REAL Pricing Data

For each brand, browse and collect 3–5 real full-price items.
Sample representative items such as:

Dresses

Tops/knits

Jeans/pants

Bags

Shoes

For shops, sample 3–5 items they typically sell that reflect their average price level.

Record prices in USD when possible. Ignore sale prices.

💰 STEP 3: Determine the Median Price Tier

Use ONLY these thresholds:

Tier	Rule
$	median under $250
$$	median $250–$450
$$$	median $450–$1100
$$$$	median over $1100, OR if the brand is a known luxury house (Prada, Loewe, YSL, Valentino, Chanel, etc.) even if the median is slightly lower

If the median is borderline, use overall brand positioning to break ties.

🧵 STEP 4: Determine the Categories

Choose all that legitimately apply based on what the brand sells:

Clothing

Shoes

Accessories

Bags

Swimwear

Jewelry

🌱 STEP 5: Determine Values

Include ONLY values that are factual and widely documented:

Sustainable (materials or verified sustainability initiatives)

Female-founded

Independent label

Ethical manufacturing

Secondhand 

BIPOC-founded

If unsure → leave blank.

📤 STEP 6: Output Format

Return a clean table with columns in this exact order:

Name | Type | Price Range | Category | Values

Each row should look like:

Tove | Brand | $$$ | Clothing | Female-founded, Independent label

Do NOT include explanations, commentary, footnotes, or extra text — only the table.

STEP 7: Determine Maximum Women’s Size (Convert if needed)

For each brand, determine the largest women’s size they offer in ready-to-wear.
Use browsing to check a few categories (dresses, pants, tops).

Rules:

If the brand uses US sizes, use the largest number directly.

If the brand uses EU / FR / IT, convert the largest size to a US women’s size using this mapping:

EU to US: US = EU – 30

FR to US: US = FR – 32

IT to US: US = IT – 34

If the brand uses letter sizing, translate as:

XXS = 0

XS = 0–2

S = 4–6

M = 8–10

L = 12–14

XL = 16–18

XXL = 18–20

3XL = 20–22

When multiple size systems exist, choose the largest equivalent.

After conversion, assign the brand to one of these buckets:

Up to 10

Up to 12

Up to 14

Up to 16

Up to 18

Up to 20+

If a brand does not clearly publish size ranges leave blank. Only put one of those options or leave it blank. Don't write anything else. 

STEP 8: Add Max Size to the Output Table

Add a new column at the end of the table:

Max Women’s Size

Each row should now look like:

Tove | Brand | $$$ | Clothing | Female-founded, Independent label | Up to 12

✔ FULL OUTPUT FORMAT (with size included)

Name | Type | Price Range | Category | Values | Max Women’s Size

Return only the table. No explanations.
