Switching to root user to install dependencies...
    You don't need sudo in Replit, all files that
    can be modified already have the correct permissions
    and you can install new software using Nix.

Tools like
apt, brew, and
yum which modify
system dependencies
are not directly
callable inside
Replit. We offer the
System Dependencies
pane for easy
dependency management.

For more information,
please check
https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/dependency-management
, and don't forget
to indicate whether
you found the
documentation helpful
at the bottom of
the page!
