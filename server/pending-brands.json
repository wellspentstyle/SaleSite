    "description": "If you're tired of choosing between architectural minimalism and throwaway trend pieces, Miista splits the difference with shoes that actually have a point of view. The London-based label specializes in sculptural block heels, contrast stitching details, and brush-off leather finishes that give their boots and mules the kind of handcrafted irregularity that makes expensive shoes from larger houses feel sterile by comparison.",

They're masters of the kind of foundational pieces that feel special—fluid crepe trousers with just-right proportions, cashmere knits in colors that photograph beautifully, and silk charmeuse pieces that transition seamlessly from day to night.",

    "description": "While other department stores chase trends or luxury retailers push logo-heavy pieces, Saks Fifth Avenue's private label quietly perfects the fundamentals—cashmere that actually gets softer with wear, cotton shirts cut with just enough ease to look polished but never stiff. Think of it as the anti-designer designer line: pieces that prioritize perfect fit and superior fabrication over flash, so you can build a wardrobe of classics that feel custom-made rather than mass-produced.",

She's obsessed with breaking down garments—shredding hems, distressing surfaces, and draping jersey and silk in ways that make everything look like your favorite piece that's been perfectly worn in over years.",

Sarah Burton has maintained the house's signature sharp-shouldered blazers, skull motifs, and dramatic silhouettes while adding her own refined femininity—think structured corsetry meets flowing chiffon, all executed with the kind of craftsmanship that justifies the investment.",
