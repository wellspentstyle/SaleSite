They've mastered the art of making basics feel special through subtle tweaks—wide-leg jeans cut just right, crewnecks in that perfect weight cotton jersey, and workwear-inspired pieces like collarless blazers and field jackets that nod to vintage without feeling costumey.",

The line keeps Margiela's signature anatomical cuts and experimental proportions—think blazers with exaggerated shoulders or trousers that somehow make your silhouette more interesting—but dials back the avant-garde gestures just enough that you won't spend your day explaining your outfit.",
