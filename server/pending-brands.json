    "description": "If you've outgrown fast fashion but aren't ready for designer prices, J.Crew occupies that crucial middle ground where you can still find a perfect cashmere sweater that doesn't require a payment plan. They're the masters of American prep done right—think Italian wool blazers with just the right amount of structure, denim with actual stretch that holds its shape, and that specific shade of navy that somehow works with everything in your closet.",
